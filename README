The Mana World - Branding Files
-------------------------------

The files in this package are meant to be used together with the ManaPlus
client released at http://manaplus.evolonline.org/.

To run The Mana World, the `tmw.mana` file can be passed as argument to the
ManaPlus client executable. This will ensure the client appears like
The Mana Worl and lists only The Mana World servers. The `data` directory
should always be located alongside the `tmw.mana` file.

A shell script and menu entry description files that perform the above
procedure are provided.
