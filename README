The Mana World - Branding Files
-------------------------------

The files in this package are meant to be used together with the Mana client
released at http://manasource.org/.

To run The Mana World, the `tmw.mana` file can be passed as argument to the
Mana client executable. This will ensure the client appears like The Mana World
and lists only The Mana World servers. The `data` directory should always be
located alongside the `tmw.mana` file.

A shell script and menu entry description files that perform the above
procedure are provided.
