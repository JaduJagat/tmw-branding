##3                      === ABOUT THE MANA WORLD ===

 ##2The Mana World##0 is a serious effort to create an innovative free
 and open source MMORPG world. The Mana World uses 2D graphics and aims to be
 as much diverse and interactive as possible. All content is licensed
 under the GPL, making sure this game can't ever run away from you.

 Mana, which develops this client and a future server, split off
to become a separate project from The Mana World, which produces
content (e.g. maps, graphics, sounds, quests) and maintains the server.
